# Structure descriptions



## Amygdala

### Short description

A highly-interconnected structure related to fear learning and responses to anxiety. It transmits sensory information to other structures.

### Long description

The amygdala is a small globule-shaped structure related to fear learning. In anxiety responses and disorders, it is highly interconnected with other structures. An increase in amygdala volume is a sign of anxiety disorders. The *basolateral* amygdala is a set of nuclei in the amygdala is that helps to process emotional and verbal responses to anxiety. It does this by integrating and transmitting sensory information to other structures.



## Medial Prefrontal Cortex *(mPFC)*

### Short description

A collection of structures near the front of the brain related to fear conditioning and long-term anxiety symptoms.

### Long description

The mPFC is a collection of long structures near the front of the brain devoted to fear conditioning and anxiety symptoms. It is highly connected to the amygdala, and participates in many anxiety responses. Its activation is stronger in those with anxiety, particularly in adolescents. Anxiety which makes up a part of individuals' personality (aka trait anxiety) is positively correlated with the right mPFC.



## Hippocampus

### Short description

A flat structure related to the manipulation and retrieval of memories. It helps to express and regulate fear.

### Long description

The hippocampus is a long, flat structure that is crucial to the encoding and retrieving of spatial and contextual memories. It helps to regulate the expression and extinction of fear, and damages to it in the brains of non-human primates impairs this. Decreased hippocampus volume is one of the risk factors for anxiety disorders in adolescents.



## Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis *(BNST)*

### Short description

An extended part of the amygdala related to anxiety response. Imbalances in its regulation may result in chronic anxiety disorders.

### Long description

The BNST is an extended part of the amygdala. It deals with stress response and anxiety maintenance, mediating it through neural circuits. It's responsible for chronic anxiety. Imbalances in its regulation, in particular in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal *(HPA)* axis, may result in anxiety disorders.



## Striatum

### Short description

A collection of structures related to the reward circuit. It contributes to anxiety symptoms and bias in many processes.

### Long description

The striatum is a name for the collection of structures known as the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and the putamen. It is considered as part of the reward circuit. Though its functional connectivity changes with age, it generally contributes to anxiety symptoms and bias in emotional, motivational, and attention processes.



## Hypothalamus

### Short description

A central part of a brain axis related to regulating emotions, defensiveness, and aggression. Sleep, stress, and caffeine can all affect it.

### Long description

The hypothalamus is a critical structure in the anxiety circuit. It is a central part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal *(HPA)* axis, which is responsible for regulating emotions, defensive behaviour, aggression, and stress responses. Circadian rhythm disturbances, stress, and caffeine affect the hypothalamus and the HPA axis, particularly in adolescents.
