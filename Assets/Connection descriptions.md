# Connection descriptions



## Cognitive control

### Short description

Signals are sent back and forth between the amygdala and the mPFC. An increase and deregulation of these signals means an increase in anxiety behaviours and disorders.

### Long description

Amygdala neurons project to different areas of the mPFC, which corresponds to an increase in anxiety behaviours and a decrease in social interaction. The mPFC projects these signals back to the amygdala, the number of which stabilizes with age. Without proper inhibition of the amygdala neurons, a basis is formed for adolescent anxiety disorders.

### Timeline

1. Amygdala -> mPFC
2. Increase in anxiety behaviours
3. mPFC -> amygdala



## Fear conditioning

### Short description

Various connections exist to and from the hippocampus, as well as between the mPFC and amygdala. These signals are related to fear learning and increase the chances of anxiety disorders, behaviours, and expressions.

### Long description

The hippocampus sends signals to the mPFC, which promotes maturation and the synchrony of the theta frequency. A decrease in these projections reduces the probability of anxiety disorders. Signals are also sent from the amygdala to the hippocampus, a decrease of which reduces anxiety behaviours and inhibits fear expression. Furthermore, signals are also sent from the mPFC to the amygdala through the hippocampus to inhibit fear expression.

### Timeline

1. Hippocampus -> mPFC (increase in maturation and theta frequency)
2. Amygdala -> hippocampus (increase in fear expression)
3. mPFC -> hippocampus -> amygdala (fear is inhibited)



## Uncertainty anticipation

### Short description

A pair of connections terminate at the BNST. They relate to the regulation and modulation of anxiety in conditions with uncertain aspects, both short and long term.

### Long description

A projection from the amygdala to the BNST relates to anxiety disorders that deal with uncertain information. The amygdala mediates immediate responses and panic, whereas the BNST mediates sustained responses and post-traumatic stress disorder *(PTSD)*. A nerve connection from the mPFC to the BNST modulates this affect.

### Timeline

1. Amygdala -> BNST (stress from uncertain information is regulated)
2. mPFC -> BNST (stress effect is modulated)



## Motivation processing

### Short description

Connections exist back and forth from the striatum to the amygdala and mPFC. They deal with rewards, motivation, decision making, and avoidance, achieving a balance with anxiety behaviours.

### Long description

The striatum utilizes emotion, motivation, and reward systems, and transmits its information to the mPFC. A projection back from the mPFC contributes to decision making. Furthermore, a connection from the amygdala to the striatum supports fight or flight responses and avoidance learning. The mPFC achieves a balance between anxiety and motivation behaviours through its interactions with these connections.

### Timeline

1. Striatum -> mPFC (increase in motivation)
2. mPFC -> striatum (decision making)
3. Amygdala -> striatum (increase in fight or flight and avoidance learning)



## Stress regulation

### Short description

The hypothalamus, amygdala, and mPFC are highly interconnected for stress. They regulate fear, aggression, and other emotions back and forth in anxiety-inducing situations.

### Long description

Connections between the hypothalamus and the amygdala regulate and maintain anxiety behaviours and excessive fear. Also, projections from the mPFC to the hypothalamus regulate emotions and aggression. Dopamine transmission from the mPFC to the amygdala in anxious situations further excites the other connections and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal *(HPA)* axis.

### Timeline

1. Hypothalamus <-> amygdala (excessive fear regulated)
2. mPFC -> hypothalamus (emotions and aggression regulated)
3. mPFC -> amygdala (other connections and HPA excited)
