// Introduction

Welcome to Insideout!
Right now, you're standing at the centre of a model of the human brain.
Brain structures will become visible in time.
Around you is the boundary box, please try to remain inside of it at all times.

// Controls

In your hands are two controllers.
You can lift them up in front of you, to see them in the 3D environment.
The left controller has a miniature brain attached to it.
This miniature represents the brain all around you.
The right controller has a line attached to it.
You can think of this line as a laser pointer.
On the underside of each controller is a trigger.
Try pulling the right controller trigger with your index finger.
[WAIT] When a button appears, you can point the laser at it, and pull the trigger to click the button.
Try clicking the button in front of you.
// TODO: add swimming?
[WAIT] Those are the only controls. Have fun!

// Pathway selection

This is the connections view.
Each connection here represents a small network of brain structures.
They each relate to a particular brain anxiety response.
Click on one of the structure connection networks.

// Structure selection

[WAIT] This is the structure view.
Here, you can cycle through the structures in this connection.
You can read about their functions and connections, and follow the timelines of neuron activation.
Click on one of the small buttons to move to the next structure.
[WAIT] Cycle through until you have viewed all the structures in the connection.
You can also go back to structures you have previously viewed.
When you're ready to return to the connection view, click on the large upper button.

// Gamification

// TODO pathway completion, structure completion, etc.

// Conclusion

// TODO: anything else needed here
[WAIT] Continue to explore connections and structures!
