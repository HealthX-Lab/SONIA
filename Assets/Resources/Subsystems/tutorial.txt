Introduction:
• The six models in front of you are the primary brain structures associated with certain anxiety responses.
• Selectable structures on the right side have been replaced with small nodes.
• Any selections within the miniature brain will be reflected upon the large brain around you.
Press the <b>'Continue'</b> button below to proceed.

Selecting structures:
• You will now be able to select any of the six structures within the miniature brain.
• To select one, wave the white line attached to your controller inside of the desired structure and press the trigger button with your index finger.
• Text will appear above the brain with the name of the structure, and a short description.

Subsystems and colour coding:
• There are subsystems of connections which are associated with various anxiety responses.
• All subsystems have distinct colours associated with them.
• The coloured pips above the names of the selected structures indicate which subsystems they are a part of.

Structure completion:
• After the first structure is selected, a list of viewed structures will appear to the left of the brain.
• You must view all structures and read their descriptions before moving on to the next step.

List of subsystems
The following <b>subsystems</b> are included:

<color=#FF0000>Cognitive control:</color>
Signals are sent back and forth between the amygdala and the mPFC. An increase and deregulation of these signals means an increase in anxiety behaviours and disorders.

<color=#CCFF00>Fear conditioning:</color>
Various connections exist to and from the hippocampus, as well as between the mPFC and amygdala. These signals are related to fear learning and increase the chances of anxiety disorders, behaviours, and expressions.

<color=#00FF66>Uncertainty anticipation:</color>
A pair of connections terminate at the BNST. They relate to the regulation and modulation of anxiety in conditions with uncertain aspects, both short and long term.

<color=#0066FF>Motivation processing:</color>
Connections exist back and forth from the striatum to the amygdala and mPFC. They deal with rewards, motivation, decision making, and avoidance, achieving a balance with anxiety behaviours.

<color=#CC00FF>Stress regulation:</color>
The hypothalamus, amygdala, and mPFC are highly interconnected for stress. They regulate fear, aggression, and other emotions back and forth in anxiety-inducing situations.

Selecting connections:
• The text above the brain has been replaced with a list of connections going to other structures.
• To select these connections, point the white line attached to your controller towards the list of connections like a laser pointer and press the trigger button with your index finger.

Connection completion:
• After the first connection is selected, a list will appear to the left of the brain.
• This list shows how many of the subsystems' connections have been viewed.
• Each subsystem is colour coded.
• You must view all connections and read their descriptions before completing the system.

Congratulations! You have now viewed all structures and all connections. You may continue to select structures and connections at will.
