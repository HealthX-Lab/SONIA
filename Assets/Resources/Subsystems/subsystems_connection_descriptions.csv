|Amygdala neurons project to different areas of the mPFC, which corresponds to an increase in anxiety behaviours and a decrease in social interaction.|Signals are also sent from the amygdala to the hippocampus, a decrease of which reduces anxiety behaviours and inhibits fear expression.|A projection from the amygdala to the BNST relates to anxiety disorders that deal with uncertain information.|A connection from the amygdala to the striatum supports fight or flight responses and avoidance learning.|Connections between the hypothalamus and the amygdala regulate and maintain anxiety behaviours and excessive fear.
The mPFC projects these signals back to the amygdala, the number of which stabilizes with age.\n\nDopamine transmission from the mPFC to the amygdala in anxious situations further excites the other connections and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.||Signals are also sent from the mPFC to the amygdala through the hippocampus to inhibit fear expression.|A nerve connection from the mPFC to the BNST modulates immediate responses and panic.|A projection back from the mPFC contributes to decision making.|Projections from the mPFC to the hypothalamus regulate emotions and aggression.
|The hippocampus sends signals to the mPFC, which promotes maturation and the synchrony of the theta frequency.||||

|The striatum utilizes emotion, motivation, and reward systems, and transmits its information to the mPFC.||||
