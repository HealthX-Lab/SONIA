Cognitive control|Signals are sent back and forth between the amygdala and the mPFC. An increase and deregulation of these signals means an increase in anxiety behaviours and disorders.
Fear conditioning|Various connections exist to and from the hippocampus, as well as between the mPFC and amygdala. These signals are related to fear learning and increase the chances of anxiety disorders, behaviours, and expressions.
Uncertainty anticipation|A pair of connections terminate at the BNST. They relate to the regulation and modulation of anxiety in conditions with uncertain aspects, both short and long term.
Motivation processing|Connections exist back and forth from the striatum to the amygdala and mPFC. They deal with rewards, motivation, decision making, and avoidance, achieving a balance with anxiety behaviours.
Stress regulation|The hypothalamus, amygdala, and mPFC are highly interconnected for stress. They regulate fear, aggression, and other emotions back and forth in anxiety-inducing situations.
